## Generalized Linear Models
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are a class of statistical models that were unified by Nelder and Wedderburn (1972). The models existed before then, but were fitted differently, and were applied independently when appropriate. The unification of these models into a class made them easier to teach, and the fitting algorithm that was developed allowed for faster and more robust parameter estimation.

The models could be unified because they have many things in common, despite being applicable to different types of data. Many more complex statistical models can be seen as an extension, or as having a relationship, with GLMs. As such, GLMs provide a strong basis for more complex statistical modeling.

This workshop teaches GLMs by first considering linear models as a special type of GLM where things function a little bit smoother, and the maths works out a little nicer. I will assume all workshop participants to be familiar with the R statistical programming language.

## Updating R
Please make sure to update your R installation prior to the workshop. Most of the code used in the workshop should function on older versions of R as well, but not all R packages used might be available or function fully.

[You can find an R installation based on your operating system here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

### Required R packages


## PROGRAM
Sessions from 14:00 to 20:00 (Monday to Thursday), 14:00 to 18:00 on Friday (Berlin time). Sessions will consist of a mix of lectures, in-class discussion, and practical exercises / case studies over Slack and Zoom.

### Monday
On the first day we will go through R basics and background theory of frequentist statistics to build a foundation for the rest of the workshop.
* Brief reminder of R programming
* Reminder of foundational statistical concepts
* Introduction to linear models

## Tuesday
* Simple linear regression
* Multiple linear regression
* Understading, visualizing output
* Model validation and predictions

## Wednesday
* ANOVA and variation partitioning.
* Model selection
* Generalized linear models (GLM) components
* GLMs for binary responses (Logistic Regression)

## Thursday
* Beta regression
* Poisson regression
* Negative binomial regression
* Other useful response distributions
  
## Friday
* Participants' case studies (bring your own data)

What lies ahead: generalized additive models, multilevel or mixed-effects models to account for hierarchical and correlated data (time, space, phylogeny).

# TODO
* List of R packages
* Add slides
